# Devices Details

### About

This `python3` script leverages the Kandji API to generate reports device details endpoint for devices in a Kandji tenant.

### Kandji API

- The API permissions required to run the reporting script are as follows. Checkout the Kandji [Knowledge Base](https://support.kandji.io) for more information.

### Dependencies

- This script relies on Python 3 to run. Python 3 can be installed directly as an [Auto App](https://support.kandji.io/kb/auto-apps-overview), from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

- Python dependencies can be installed individually below, or with the included `requirements.txt` file using the following command from a Terminal: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

    ```
    python3 -m pip install requests
    python3 -m pip install pathlib
    ```

### Script Modification

1. Open the script in a text editor such as BBEdit or VSCode.
1. Update the `SUBDOMAIN` variable to match your Kandji subdomain, the Kandji tenant `REGION`, and update `TOKEN` information with your Bearer token.

    - The `BASE_URL`, `REGION`, and `TOKEN` can be found by logging into Kandji then navigate to `Settings > Access > API Token`. From there, you can copy the information out of the API URL and generate API tokens.
    - For US-based tenants the `REGION` can either be `us` or left as an empty string (`""`)

        *NOTE*: The API token is only visible at the point of creation so be sure to copy it to a safe location.

        ```python
        ########################################################################################
        ######################### UPDATE VARIABLES BELOW #######################################
        ########################################################################################

        SUBDOMAIN = "accuhive"  # bravewaffles, example, company_name

        # us("") and eu - this can be found in the Kandji settings on the Access tab
        REGION = ""

        # Kandji Bearer Token
        TOKEN = ""
        ```

1. Save and close the script.

### Running the Script

1. Copy this script to a common location. i.e. Desktop
2. Launch a Terminal window and navigate to your Desktop using the following command.

    `cd ~/Desktop`

3. Enter the following command in the Terminal window to see script options.

    `python3 device_details.py --help`

    ```text
    usage: device_details [-h] [--ade-eligible [yes|no]] [--auto-enrolled [yes|no]] [--device-activation-lock [on|off]] [--filevault [on|off]] [--kandji-agent [yes|no]] [--os-version "13.2.1"] [--prk-escrowed [yes|no]] [--processor-type [Intel|Apple]] [--recovery-lock [on|off]] [--remote-desktop [on|off]]
                        [--user-activation-lock [on|off]] [--all-details] (--serial-number XX7FFXXSQ1GH | --blueprint [blueprint_name] | --platform [Mac|iPhone|iPad|AppleTV]) [--version]

    Generate reports containing information from the device details API.

    options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --version             Show this tool's version.

    Query options:
    The following option can be used to create queries against devices in a Kandji instance. 
    Multiple options can be combined together.

    --ade-eligible [yes|no]
                            Return devices that are either ADE eligible (yes) via Apple Business Manager or not (no).
    --auto-enrolled [yes|no]
                            Return devices that were either automatically enrolled(yes) via Automated Device Enrollment and Apple Business Manager or not(no).
    --device-activation-lock [on|off]
                            Return devices where device-based activation lock is either on or off.
    --filevault [on|off]  Return macOS devices where FileVault is on or off
    --kandji-agent [yes|no]
                            Return macOS devices where the Kandji agent is or is not installed.
    --os-version "13.2.1"
                            Look for devices with OS versions matching the version string specified. If 13 is passed, for example, all devices with an OS version that starts with 13 will be returned.
    --prk-escrowed [yes|no]
                            Return macOS devices where FileVault PRK has either been escrowed (yes) or not (no).
    --processor-type [Intel|Apple]
                            Return devices with the specified processor architecture.
    --recovery-lock [on|off]
                            Return macOS devices where recovery lock is either on or off.
    --remote-desktop [on|off]
                            Return macOS devices where remote desktop is either on or off.
    --user-activation-lock [on|off]
                            Return devices where user-based activation lock is either on or off. If user-based activation lock is on this means that the user has signed into iCloud with a personal Apple ID.
    --all-details         Just give me everything for all devices. No filters please...

    Limit search:
    A search can be limited to a specific device, blueprint, or an entire device platform. A search 
    can be limited to a specific device, blueprint, or an entire device platform. If no options are 
    specified, the script will search through all devices in the Kandji tenant

    --serial-number XX7FFXXSQ1GH
                            Search for a specific device by serial number.
    --blueprint [blueprint_name]
                            Search for devices in a specific blueprint in a Kandji instance.
    --platform [Mac|iPhone|iPad|AppleTV]
                            Enter a specific device platform type. This will limit the search results to only the specified platform. Examples: Mac, iPhone, iPad, AppleTV.
    ```

4. A csv file with will be generated in the current directory, which, in this example would be the `Desktop`.

### Examples

- Generate a report containing devices that have user activation lock turned on.

    `python3 device_details.py --user-activation-lock on`

- Generate a report containing devices that have user activation lock on, processor is Apple silicon, and ADE enrolled yes.

    `python3 device_details.py --auto-enrolled yes --user-activation-lock on --processor-type Apple`

- Generate a report containing all Mac computers with a FileVault PRK escrowed.

    `python3 device_details.py --platform "Mac" --prk-escrowed yes`

- Generate a report containing all details for all devices. No filtering applied.

    `python3 device_details.py --all-details`
