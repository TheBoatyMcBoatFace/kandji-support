# Blueprint Switcher <img src="images/blueprint_switcher.png" width="200"> 

This script is designed to move Mac computers already enrolled into Kandji from one Blueprint to another.

## Requirements
* This script ([`blueprint_switcher.zsh`](blueprint_switcher.zsh))
* An API token with the following permissions:
  * List Blueprints
  * Get Blueprint
  * Update a Device
  * Device details
  * Device List
  ![api permissions](images/api_permissions.png)

This script does not require any additional script libraries or dependencies.
  
## Instructions
1. Generate an API token for this automation in the Kandji tenant with the following privileges:
  * List Blueprints
  * Get Blueprint
  * Update a Device
  * Device details
  * Device List

2. Download the [`blueprint_switcher.zsh`](blueprint_switcher.zsh) script. Edit the script and add your **kandji subdomain**, the **API token** you generated in step 1, and the **blueprint name or UUID** you want the Mac assigned to in the `USER INPUT` section of the script.
```shell
##############################################################
# USER INPUT 
##############################################################

# Kandji Subdomain
subdomain="mycompany"

# Region (us and eu) - this can be found in the Kandji settings on the Access tab
region="us"

# API Bearer Token
token="your-token-here"

# Blueprint name/UUID (This is the name of the Blueprint as it exists in Kandji that you want to assign devices to).
assignBlueprint="MyBlueprint"
```

3. Create a new **Custom Script** Library item. Change the icon and name as desired, assign it to a Blueprint, and paste your code in.

4. Test and Validate before deploying to production.

## Icon
Here's an icon you can use if you'd like:

## Usage Examples

### Blueprint Switching via Self Service
In a situation where someone wants to assign all Mac computers to a default Blueprint and then have the end-user assign themselves to the appropriate department/role Blueprint via Self Service after they log in for the first time. (In cases where assignment via Identity Provider Group isn't available.)

This is also helpful for depot/warehouse scenarios where technicians may need to choose the intended purpose of a device (i.e. Kiosk Mac vs Caching Server) before shipping it to its final destination.

Create a Custom Script Library Item and enable it for Self Service, allowing the end-user or the IT admin configuring the Mac to click on the appropriate Department/Blueprint in Self Service to switch the enrolled Mac to that Blueprint.

### Blueprint Switching via Assignment Rules
Leverage Assignment Rules to automate switching of a Mac to a Blueprint based on IDP User Group, Department, or Job Title.
1. Add this script to a Custom Script Library item.
2. Assign it a Blueprint your Mac computers enroll into.
3. Edit the User Input section of the script with the appropriate details for the Blueprint you want the Mac switched to.

### Other
Any other scenario where you want to automate the switching of an enrolled Mac from one Blueprint to another. You can use it in a Library Item like in the examples above, where it will run locally on the Mac, or you can use the script on a VM for automation.
* One could leverage this script with some other logic to switch Blueprints based on any other available information (i.e. trigger after certain criteria are met using audit scripts, etc)

### New Device Enrollment Considerations
Running this script as part of an initial enrollment may interrupt agent runs in progress when it switches the Blueprint of a device.
If youâ€™d like to switch Blueprints after a device initially enrolls into a default Blueprint, you can combine this script with [`installafterLiftoff`](https://github.com/kandji-inc/support/tree/main/Scripts/install-after-liftoff) to ensure the device changes Blueprints only after it has completed its initial enrollment.

## Troubleshooting
* **I'm getting an error**
  * Double-check that you're using a valid API token with the correction permissions and that your Kandji subdomain is correct.
  * Check the output logs in the library item in Kandji, or run `log show --style compact --process "logger" | grep "bp_switcher"` on the device that is running the script to view the logs.
